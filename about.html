        <p>I am a software developer with a strong Mathematics background and experience in Ruby on Rails, Javascript, and other backend and frontend technologies. I look forward to bringing my leadership mentality, attention to detail, and competitive nature to a development team in a full-time role. </p>

<p>I discovered my passion for programming when I took an Intro to C++ course while pursuing my BS in Math and Applied Science at UCLA. For the first time, I fully enjoyed a college course and knew that I wanted a career in software development. After I graduated, I co-founded and acted as COO for an environmentally sustainable car-detailing business in Beverly Hills. This experience taught me the challenges of leading and contributing to the team of a startup business. After growing the business to include two locations and a mobile detailing unit within one year, I left to pursue my dream of being a software developer. I attended App Academy in San Francisco to further my programming skills and was able to build full stack websites by the end of the 6 month course. </p>
<p>I currently work as a Lead Coding Instructor for a Coding School called Hackingtons. At Hackingtons I teach Web Development, Python, and Unity to students with ages ranging from 8 to 16 years old.</p>
<p>Programming and Technology fascinates me and I will always be looking to gain more knowledge and expand my skillset.</p>

        <h3>UCLA</h3>
        <h4>Bachelors of Science Degree- Math and Applied Sciences</h4>
        <p>As a Math and Applied Sciences major at UCLA, I took a wide variety of classes in addition to Math with the initial goal of going to Medical school. These courses include Chemisty, Biology, Physics, and Neuroscience. It wasn't until I took Intro to C++ that I knew what I wanted to do for a career.
            The topics in the course stuck with me and I enjoyed applying logic and mathematics skills towards creating real programs. </p>

        <h3>App Academy</h3>
        <h4>Fullstack Developer Student</h4>
        <p>App Academy was recommended to me by a college friend who worked in the Tech industry as a great school to learn Web Development.
        Despite only having a 3% acceptance rate, I decided to take a shot and apply. After being accepted, I spent the next 6 months learning and working on my programming skills. It was an incredibly rigorous course, but it was also one of the best experiences of my life, teaching me valuable time management skills and strengthening my work ethic.</p>

        <h3>Hackingtons Code School</h3>
        <h4>Lead Coding Instructor</h4>
        <p>With my programming knowledge and experience as a Middle and High School Volleyball coach, Hackingtons was the perfect fit for my skillset and personality.
        As the Lead Coding Instructor, it is my job to run a classroom of students and ensure that everyone has their projects functioning and error free. I was also tasked with creating videos and projects that teach kids certain computer and frontend skills. Running the classes is a blast and many of the kids bring out a creative side of me and inspire new project ideas to better my own skills.</p>
