        <p>I am a software developer with a strong Mathematics background and experience in Ruby on Rails, Javascript, and other backend and frontend technologies. I look forward to bringing my leadership mentality, attention to detail, and competitive nature to a development team in a full-time role. </p>

<p>I discovered my passion for programming when I took an Intro to C++ course while pursuing my BS in Math and Applied Science at UCLA. From that moment I knew I wanted to pursue career in software development. I later co-founded and acted as COO for an environmentally sustainable car-detailing business in Beverly Hills. This experience taught me the challenges of leading and contributing to the team of a startup business. After growing the business to include two locations and a mobile detailing unit within one year, I left to attend App Academy to further my programming skills. </p>
<p>I am a Lead Coding Instructor for Hackingtons Code School. The curriculum includes HTML, CSS, Javascript, Python, and Unity. </p>
<p>Programming and Technology fascinates me and I will always be looking to gain more knowledge and expand my skillset.</p>
